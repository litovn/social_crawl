That attention was the new currency and would play a major part in my success as an entrepreneur.So, I started building my brand on LinkedIn in early 2019. And the results were pretty phenomenal.In just 6 months I grew from zero followers to over 20,000.And on August 1st of 2019, I walked away from my executive role at a fast-growing startup.Since that day, I've spent my time building a number of one-person Internet businesses.My mission is to be the \"Diversified Solopreneur.\" My results:‚Üí $6.7M+ in business revenue at a 90% profit margin.‚Üí 550K+ people following my journey on LinkedIn‚Üí 475K+ people following my journey on Twitter‚Üí 215K+ people read my weekly newsletter‚Üí 600M+ impressions in the last 4 yearsIf you want to learn more about how I did this, you can take one of my self-guided courses.THE OPERATING SYSTEM DIGITAL COURSEIn this 120-minute course, you will learn the complete LinkedIn operating system that I used to grow from 0 to 500k followers and earn $6.7M+ in income with zero advertisements.

            "post": "Here are 12 powerful pieces of advice I'd give to aspiring internet entrepreneurs.  1. There is a business idea in your practical work experience, but also in the things you are obsessed with. Lean in.  2. Your unique value proposition is key to your success. Why should someone choose you over all of the people out there? (more here: https://lnkd.in/eX27xCZG)  3. Distribution is your best friend. If you can't share you message effectively, you're going to struggle.  4. Create content you enjoy creating, not what you think is \"best\". Like to write? Write. Like video? Record. Consistency is what matters, so you'd better like it.  5. Create systems and frameworks for turning your ideas into creative pieces of content that people will enjoy. No systems? Gonna be tough. (more here: https://lnkd.in/eGAABFwX)  6. Build for the long-term. Rather than trying to generate a ton of revenue right from the start, think about under-promising, under-pricing, and over-delivering. That early trust will pay off in the long run.  7. The more niche you are, the more you can sell products and services. The more broad you are, the more creative you'll have to get.  8. You become really good when you understand who you're serving, what you're helping them do, and what outcome they can expect. This becomes your content language. (more here: https://lnkd.in/eiwMuH3W)  9. You become great when you analyze everything you're doing, and form hypotheses about what's working and what isn't.  10. You become excellent when you take action against those hypotheses until you solve the problems.  11. Business is never \"done\". You're either moving forward or getting worse. The default mode in entrepreneurship is reverse.  12. Automation is the great differentiator. If your revenue can be generated by content and email sequences that work when you're sleeping, you'll be tough to beat.  Hope these are helpful.  Would love to hear some of your best advice.

When I see one, I understand the person got it for engaging with low-quality, AI-generated content. Often posting AI-generated answers.The badges are also misleading. LinkedIn uses them to promote their AI features, but doesn't explain to the users what they actually mean. It's a top AI Commentator, not the Top Voice. So, I have serious ethical doubts.Unfortunately I got one, they enabled it without asking for my permission. I saw it 2-3 hours later and hid it immediately.Dr Bart Jaworski, Jason Knight and other creators raised similar doubts."

When you work for yourself (yes, it's hard) you can choose to continue driving for profit only...or you can choose to focus on building a high-quality life and then figuring out how to support that with enough profit. No wrong choice. Just different."
